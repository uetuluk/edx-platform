# Version constraints for pip-installation.
#
# This file doesn't install any packages. It specifies version constraints
# that will be applied if a package is needed.
#
# When pinning something here, please provide an explanation of why.  Ideally,
# link to other information that will help people in the future to remove the
# pin when possible.  Writing an issue against the offending project and
# linking to it here is good.


# This file contains all common constraints for edx-repos

# As it is not clarified what exact breaking changes will be introduced as per
# the next major release, ensure the installed version is within boundaries.

# The team that owns this package will manually bump this package rather than having it pulled in automatically.
# This is to allow them to better control its deployment and to do it in a process that works better
# for them.
edx-enterprise==3.51.1

# oauthlib>3.0.1 causes test failures ( also remove the django-oauth-toolkit constraint when this is fixed )

# Release 2.1.0 pulls declares `pact-python` as a base requirement, even though it should be
# a testing requirement. Installing it would cause a bunch of new tool packages to become base
# requirements of edx-platform. Pinning temporarily until this is resolved in edx-val.
edxval<2.1

# At the time of writing this comment, we do not know whether py2neo>=2022

# mistune is a dependency of m2r (which is a dependency of sphinxcontrib-openapi)
# m2r fails to specify the version of mistune that it needs leading to the error message:
# AttributeError: module 'mistune' has no attribute 'BlockGrammar'
# See Issue: https://github.com/miyakogi/m2r/issues/66
# m2r is no longer actively maintained: https://github.com/miyakogi/m2r/pull/43
# This will be fixed when sphinxcontrib-openapi depends on m2r2 instead of m2r
# See issue: https://github.com/sphinx-contrib/openapi/issues/123
mistune<2.0.0
